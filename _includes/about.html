          I took my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the Western Paraná State University.
          During my last semester, I did an internship with IAESTE at
          <a href="https://www.kisters.de/">Kisters AG</a>
          in Aachen, Germany. I worked on the development of a data hub for raster data products
          from remote sensing, reanalysis, and other sources.

          On my thisis I developed a Inteligent Tutoring System (ITS) for learning fractions to
          children called "<a href="http://inf.unioeste.br/~tcc/2017/TCC%20-%20Lyssa%20Scherer.pdf"
